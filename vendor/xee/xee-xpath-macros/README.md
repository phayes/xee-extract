Support macros to make it easy to create library functions for XPath. Used by
[`xee-interpreter`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-interpreter) in the [library
submodule](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/tree/main/xee-interpreter/src/library).

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
