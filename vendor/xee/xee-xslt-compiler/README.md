Transform XSLT AST as defined by
[`xee-xslt-ast`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xslt-ast) into IR so that it can
be executed by [`xee-interpreter`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-interpreter).

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
