This is the implementation of parser and AST for XPath expressions. This is
used by [`xee-xpath-compiler`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xpath-compiler). It
builds on [`xee-xpath-lexer`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xpath-lexer).

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
