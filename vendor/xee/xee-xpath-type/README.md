Type information for XPath. This is that part of the AST that defines function
signatures. It's been extracted into its own crate so that it can be used by
the macro subsystem in
[`xee-xpath-macros`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xpath-macros).

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
