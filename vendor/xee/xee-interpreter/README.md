`xee-interpreter` provides the runtime to run Xee code. It includes a
bytecode interpreter, an implementation of XPath data types, and the XPath
standard library.

This is used by [`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/) to
implement XPath and can also serve as the engine to execute XSLT code (work in
progress). 

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
