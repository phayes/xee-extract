# qt3tests

This repository contains around 30,000 tests for XPath and XQuery, developed by the W3C XQuery and XSLT Working Groups. 

The tests cover XPath 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1, and XQuery 1.0, 3.0, and 3.1.

There is metadata with each test to indicate its dependencies (which language versions and optional language 
features it requires), and its required environment (resources such as source XML files).

The metadata also defines the expected results of each test, as a set of one or more assertions.

The test suite does not include test drivers for particular XQuery implementations.

Further information about the test suite is available in various documents in the "guide" directory.
