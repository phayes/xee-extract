   <!--
      this test set contains a random collection of more "aspriring" tests that do not test
      any specific spec behavior, but follow either from real-world scenarios, are the result
      or part of test-auto-creation tools, or are otherwise "application" tests.
      
      This set followed from the desire to be able to test work done elsewhere, i.e. on forums,
      in projects, stack-exchange and during structural testing of implementations.
      
      Problems with these tests can be harder to disentangle than with other tests. Nevertheless,
      it is the aim that the stylesheets and packages in this set attempt to find issues with
      combination and interoperable when combining multiple features of the spec. Issues found
      here are therefore just as much test-bugs and should be reported as for any other tests.
