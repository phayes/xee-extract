The files in this directory represent expected results for a processor
using Unicode 3.1. They were generated using Saxon 9.2 on the Java platform.

For a processor using a different Unicode version, add another version of the
results in a different directory. The stylesheet itself checks all relevant
versions: it does not depend on the test driver to do so.
