<head>Introduction</head>
<p>
I suppose it happens to all of us. Most days we just go through our
drab lives, writing LaTeX code, running dvips, staring at
laser-printer output, arguing about XML; but then something cracks,
our brain spins, and we pretend for whole moments at a time that we
are, after all, the rightful poetic heirs to Shakespeare and
Goethe. Luckily, we do not often get our masterpieces onto paper, but
at the TUG 1999 conference delegates were treated to a rare display of 
collective insane poetasting.</p><p>
Ross Moore and Wendy McKay started it all,
by setting up a poetry competition before the meeting, but they had
the idea that people would take it <emph>seriously</emph>, and compose
`masterpieces of the poetic art'. When it came to the line, though,
entries were thin on the ground, so what to do? Appeal to people's
worst instincts, of course, by reading doggerel to them between
talks! This was proving amusing enough by the Wednesday of the
conference that we had the idea of a public reading in the Rose Garden
of the University Campus, overlooking the sea. It seemed an innocent
enough idea.
</p><p>
TeX people are, however, nothing if not perfectionists. No, not just a 
reading, it had to be a proper party; no, we could not just read
poetry, we had to dress up in bardic uniform; no, not just any
uniform, but like that wretched lion in The Book; yes, with the laurel 
twigs. &lt;sigh&gt;, as the say on the Internet. Worst of all, people
brought cameras!
</p><p>
The results, poetic and photographic, follow. Great art it ain't,
mostly, but we hope you'll be a little amused by it all. Myself, I
think the beer (illegal in a public place in Canada) helped; about 
the local mango cider, I am less sure. I wonder what the bemused
passers-by made of it all? 
</p>
<p>Prizes? Yes, we had some winners. For unadulerated audacious
stealing, Fred Bartlett's Hamlet bore away a token; for pure cool
<emph>style</emph>, Michael Downes' haiku gained the wreath; for
poetic talent, Pierre Mackay probably came as near art as anyone; and
for his out-and-out politically incorrect (but hideously funny)
`goodness gracious me' readings, Kaveh Bazargan surely got the most applause.

<div2><head>The Journey of the TeXxies</head>
<lg>
<l>"A cold coding we had of it,</l>
<l>Just the worst package from TeXLive</l>
<l>For a document, and such a long document:</l>
<l>The macros long and the braces many,</l>
<l>The very pits of TeX."</l>
<l>And the tables hard, badly-aligned, refractory,</l>
<l>Misplaced \omit in every \multicolumn.</l>
<l>There were times we regretted</l>
<l>The dependence on longtable, the use of pdfmark,</l>
<l>And the hyperref macros breaking our \cite s.</l>
<l>Then the authors cursing and grumbling</l>
<l>And using Macintoshes, and wanting their Framemaker and Word,</l>
<l>And the editor crashing, and the graphics corrupted,</l>
<l>And the setup.exe hostile and CTAN unfriendly</l>
<l>And the usergroups dirty and charging high prices:</l>
<l>A hard time we had of it.</l>
<l>At the end we preferred to work in XML,</l>
<l>Validating as we went,</l>
<l>With the voices singing in our ears, saying</l>
<l>That this was all folly.</l>
<l>Then at <![CDATA[</tei.2>]]> we came to the end of the process,</l>
<l>valid, with all elements ended, all IDREFs satisfied,</l>
<l>With an XSL stylesheet, and even a version for IE5</l>
<l>And three HTML versions already on the Web.</l>
<l>And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.</l>

<head>To TeX or not to TeX</head>
<lg>
<l>To TeX, or not to TeX: that is the question:</l>
<l>Whether 'tis nobler on the page to suffer</l>
<l>The slings and arrows of outrageous software,</l>
<l>Or to write code against a sea of troubles,</l>
<l>And by opposing end them? Use Word? Use Quark?</l>
<l>No more! For such as they could never end</l>
<l>The heartache and the thousand unnatural shocks</l>
<l>That type is heir to.</l>
<l rend="indent(2)">LaTeXe*?</l>
<l>Devoutly to be wish'd! Or Quark to TeX?</l>
<l>To TeX? Now there's a dream. And here's the rub:</l>
<l>From that disguis&egrave;d TeX the dream may come</l>
<l>That TeX should shuffle off this mortal coil,</l>
<l>So should we pause? There's no respect</l>
<l>For TeX in all of its long life;</l>
<l>For who would bear the whips and scorns of Frame,</l>
<l>WordPerfect's wrong, Microsoft's contumely,</l>
<l>The pangs of despis'd TeX, Incontext's delay,</l>
<l>The insolence of Active TeX and the spurns</l>
<l>That patient Wizards of th' <hi rend="sc">wysiwyg</hi>ers take,</l>
<l>When he himself might his quietus make</l>
<l>In a plain TeX style? Who would authors bear,</l>
<l>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</l>
<l>But that the dread of something after TeX,</l>
<l>The undiscover'd standard from <hi rend="sc">iso</hi></l>
<l>And W3C, puzzles the will</l>
<l>And makes us rather love the type we have</l>
<l>Than fly to others that we know not of?</l>
<l rend="indent(1)">TeX's enterprise of great pith and moment</l>
<l>With <hi rend="sc">xml</hi> its currents join anon,</l>
<l>And gain the funds of moguls.</l>

a certain control sequence that is normally undefined is defined in an
obvious way. Can you identify the control sequence in question?

<l>Oh,  what a tangled web is TeX,</l>
<l>or so it seems at the outset;</l>
<l>for highest quality, the best to look,</l>
<l>Oh why did I choose to typeset my own book!</l>
<l> ..... </l>
<l>For Macintosh users the skies are quite blue,</l>
<l>with Barry to help you and Ben Salzburg too.</l>
<l>With Art, Ross, and Uwe ready to assist,</l>
<l>just send a short email to Gary Gray's (Textures) list.</l>
<l> ..... </l>
<l>If shareware type software is more to your taste,</l>
<l>your super-fast Power-Mac need not go to waste.</l>
<l>There's CMac- and Direct-TeX to lessen the sorrow,</l>
<l>and that great program OzTeX, by Andrew Trevorrow.</l>
<l> ..... </l>
<l>For Unix-like platforms the software's all free,</l>
<l>with a teTeX installation from the TeX-Live CD,</l>
<l>which collects all the pieces and orders all parts,</l>
<l>Thanks to Thomas Esser, Kaja, and Sebastian Rahtz.</l>
<l> ..... </l>
<l>Leslie Lamport created LaTeX nearly fifteen years ago.</l>
<l>It evolved into 2-epsilon by a process rather slow.</l>
<l>Improvements are numerous; results you can see.</l>
<l>Thanks to Carlisle, Mittelbach and Rowley, </l>
<l>It'll be even  better with release LaTeX3. </l>
<l> ..... </l>
<l>For PostScript Type1 fonts exquisitely drawn,</l>
<l>The expert is Berthold, whose surname is Horn.</l>
<l>Where the yin meets the yang in the great cosmic goo,</l>
<l>Don't get this name mixed-up with Louis Vosloo.</l>

I don't have a TeX-themed poem, ala, but I do have one appropriate to
another TeX theme this year- -mathematics and publishing. Here's my
tribute to the unsung sexy heroes of mathematics. All phrases are bona
fide mathematics terms of art. Really!

<l>Step into the garden of conjectures and see</l>
<l>my Julia sets are uniformly perfect. </l>
<l>Forget your nilpotence and steenrod algebras,</l>
<l>my theta divisor is very ample.</l>
<l>In this land of lemmata,</l>
<l>you'll glide with the smoothness of Kelley</l>
<l>while I, I'll gather the perverse sheaves</l>
<l>and quivers, and we'll dance</l>
<l>'til our zeta functions converge.</l>
<l>Sipping modular moonshine, we'll reach </l>
<l>the highest eigenvalue without effort.</l>
<l>In this holomorphic vector field</l>
<l>with totally degenerate zeroes,</l>
<l>we may even discover the essence of chaos.</l>

<l>Oh what a tangled web we get</l>
<l>when first we practice to typeset.</l>
<l>And so we read TeX master Knuth</l>
<l>Hoping to Obtain some truth.</l>
<l>Or else we read through the book of Spivak</l>
<l>but end up simply crying Alack!</l>
<l>And then we go and join the TUG</l>
<l>trying to make our process chug.</l>
<l>Beginners know why the rhyme for TeX</l>
<l>is often the frustrated Blecchh.</l>
<l>I can't even get a .dvi file,</l>
