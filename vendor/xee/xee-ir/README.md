Implementation of the IR (intermediate representation) of Xee. This IR is
generated by
[`xee-xpath-compiler`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xpath-compiler), and also
by [`xee-xslt-compiler`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-xslt-compiler). Provides
a way to compile the IR to bytecode, which can then be interpreted by
[`xee-interpreter`](https://crates.io/crates/xee-interpreter).

This is a low-level crate of the [Xee project](https://github.com/Paligo/xee).
For the API entry point see
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/). For the `xee`
commandline tool, download a
[release](https://github.com/Paligo/xee/releases/).
